The site has been re-implemented in TinaCMS; the previous version used highly customized Strapi. Strapi itself is a really good service. It just doesn't guarantee stability with any free-tier backend services.

# Renewal Goal

- must not show error page
  - this was due to slow-bootup time of free-tier backend services
- maintain full-pledged markdown support
- maintain same(at least similar look to the previous one)
- must be able to edit even when away from main computer, without dev environment settings
