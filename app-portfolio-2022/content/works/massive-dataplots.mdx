title: WebGL Massive Data Plot Visualization Proof-of-Concept
---

A proof-of-concept webGL app that renders massive interactive data plots(over 150,000) with performance(over 60 fps).

I've created the demo at work, to prove that it is indeed possible to render a huge amount of data plots in a single web page. It heavily uses webGL shader.
