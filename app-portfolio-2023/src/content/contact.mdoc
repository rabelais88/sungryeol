Hi, I am 박성렬(朴成烈) from South Korea. For those who can't understand Korean or the Chinese letters, I use the romanized version of my name on the web; Park Sungryeol. It's \[pak̚s̕ʌŋɲyʌl] in IPA. If it's too difficult to pronounce, please just call me Max(or Maxwell). I am not so picky about how people calling me, so please pick the one you like.

I especially love❣️ data📈, visuals👁️ and cool stuff😎.
